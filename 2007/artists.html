<b>How does graphic design (and communication in general) work?</b><br /> 
Is it purely subjective, a matter of personal opinion, or are there rules to be revealed? If so, can these rules be programmed into an artificially creative algorithm that aids human designers in their search for the right design?

	What is generativity? <br />
	Do letters live? <br />
	Which genes describe a type? <br />
	Can typography and genetics be connected? <br />
	Can types reproduce themselves? <br /><br />

	<b>genoTyp</b> tries to find answers and regards typefaces under genetic aspects. 
	Their characteristics are encoded in hereditary factors.
	Different fonts can be mixed as desired and their genomes can be manipulated. New fonts are generated according to genetic rules.

</p>

<div class="subtitled"><a href="http://www.ricardmarxer.com/">ricardmarxer.com</a> - Spain</div>
<p>
   <b> Calligraphy</b> is the art of decorative handwriting. 
From a formal point of view we are talking about decorative ways of representing the ideas of glyphs that we have in our mind. This same idea can be translated to the domain of computation, the result is what I call computational calligraphies.
    <br /><br />
	This shouldn't be understood as trying to imitate human calligraphies using a computer. It means to use computation to create new representations of fonts, which can be considered as the digital representations of the ideas of glyphs.

	<b>An Information Graphic About the World Religion's Holy Books.</b><br />
	Similar Diversity is an information graphic which opens up a new perspective at the topics religion and faith by visualizing the Holy
	Books of five world religions. Communalities and differences of Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, Buddhism and Judaism are shown up in
	this datavisualization. <br />
	The visual's basis is an objective text analysis of the Holy Scriptures, and works without any interpretations from the creators' side.
	Despite - or even because of this abstraction, the artworks are not only working on an informal but also on an emotional level. The
	viewers should be inspired to think about own prejudices and current religious conflicts.

<div class="subtitled"><a href="http://sq.ro/">sq.ro</a> - Romania/USA</div>
<p>
<b>Alex Dragulescu</b> is a Romanian visual artist whose practice embraces both traditional and new media. His projects are experiments and explorations of algorithms, computational models, simulations and information visualizations that involve data derived from databases, spam emails, blogs and video game assets. <br />
His work has been exhibited in solo and group exhibitions worldwide in Madrid, Venice, Florence, Rome, Sao Paolo, St Petersburg, La Habana, Arad, Kiasma Museum of Contemporary Art, Helsinki and the Biennial of Young Artists, Bucharest. In 2005, his software agent Blogbot, won the IBM New Media Award at the Stuttgart Festival for Expanded Media in Germany.<br />
He has a BS in Cinema and Photography from Ithaca College and a Masters of Fine Arts in Visual Arts from University of California at San Diego.  He recently left the Experimental Game Lab at the Center for Research in Computing and the Arts at UCSD and joined the Sociable Media Group at MIT's Media Lab. <br /><br />

The images from the Spam Architecture series are generated by a computer program that accepts as input, junk email. Various patterns, keywords and rhythms found in the text are translated into three-dimensional modeling gestures.

<p>
<b>V-Scratch</b> is a software/hardware environment which allows for unique visual interpretations in turntable composition. 
It transposes nuances made by the rotation of the record: the variations of speed, audio spectrum and volume. 
In addition, the physical act of spinning the record back and forth is transmitted through an optical mouse. 
All these variables enable a simultaneous performance of moving image and sound while creating an infinite space for possible results.

	Welcome to generative music!<br /> 
	OM players are designed to create smooth ambient 
	music soundscapes that change and evolve endlessly 
	without the need of interaction.<br /> 
	Generative music has a long history.<br /> 
	The most ancient examples of self generated music are 
	windchimes. OM players bring this concept a step further 
	Modern digital technology give us the chance to create 
	instruments that can be played by your computer 
	endlessly, following programmed musical rules rather 
	than note-by-note musical scores.<br /> 
	OM transforms your computer into a live, organic 
	soudscape and art installation.

	The harmony of things is contained in their perennial change.   <br />

	This change is not random or chaotic; it is governed by precise rhythms. <br />

	"everything flows" is an eternal flow, constantly evolving, never equal to himself.
