<p>Marius Watz is an artist concerned with generative systems for creating visual
  form, still, animated or realtime. His signature is a brand of visual hedonism,
  marked by colourful organic shapes and a maximalist attitude. Most of his works
  deal with drawing machines implemented in software, live visuals for music
or large-scale projections of plastic visual systems.<br />
Watz discovered the computer
  at age 11 and immediately found his direction in life. At age 20 he defected
  from Computer Science studies to do graphics for raves, using his programming
  to create organic shapes in 2D and 3D. In parallel to creating his own work,
  Watz worked as a graphic designer for many years, probing the limits of design.
  He ran the studio Products of Play with Erik Johan Wors&oslash;e Eriksen before
  deciding to focus on his art practice.</p>

<p>Limiteazero is an architecture, media design and media art duo based in Milan,
Italy, founded at the end of the previous century.<br />
In its experimental activity, Limiteazero manages to mix different languages
and areas of expertise, from media communication to architecture, from Italian
design and craft tradition to electronic aesthetics.<br />
Their work is based on an informal mix of heterogeneous languages (architecture,
design, art, math, music, physics, computer science...), with results of rigorous
hybridity which test the boundaries of embodied algorithmic composition.<br />
The duo has widely exhibited its works in festivals, art exhibitions and public
venues as: UNPlugged - Ars Electronica 2002 (Carnivore exhibition); Techne02
- arte e interattivit&aacute;, Spazio Oberdan, Milan; Netizens, 'Sala 1' art
gallery, Rome; Microwave Media Art Festival, Hong Kong; Media.comm(unity)/comm.medium
- MASEDU, Contemporary Art Center, Sassari (Italy); Villette-Numerique - La Villette,
Paris (Carnivore exhibition); Fondazione Michetti - Francavilla al Mare (Italy).<br />
Solo exhibition: 0006_limiteazero, Hublab gallery in Milan.</p>

<p>Alessandro Capozzo (1970) is a media artist and designer, he studied musicology
  and also pursued his own interest in composition and electronic music. <br />
  Currently he is focused on digital arts and particularly on software poetics. <br />
  His personal research is focused on creating generative / interactive aesthetic
  software and media installations. <br />
  The project Abstract-codex is a result of this perspective, in which main focus
  is exploring the possibilities of coding as an expressive medium. <br />
  In this vision, code is the material which digital works are made of and at
  the same time it appears as a revealed creative process: algorithms and computational
  strategies result both minimal constructive elements and generators of micro/macro
  formal organizations. <br />
  This attitude will aim at a coherent modulation of contents through an idiomatic
approach to the medium.</p>



<p>Alessando Capozzo lives and works in Milan, Italy.</p>

<p>He feels part of that odd and hybrid category, that attracted by design
  and aestetic, and, paradoxical, by the cold math's elaboration through computing
 practice.<br />
  He works mainly in digital within, in visual, performance and intallations
  fields. He uses and often abuses the interactive possibilities between audience
  and work, in order to make misunderstanding and random processes.<br />
  The creative activity is born in music field in order to mix with the work activity
  as graphic designer. The result is an attraction to radical research within
  the new technologies, which 'interaction' is become the main factor.<br />
  Case, cause-effect, indefinite time, are the common factors of all
  the creative activity. The modalities in order to trigger events and modifications
  can change, but in all of these remains the possibility that the result
cannot be previewed.</p>
